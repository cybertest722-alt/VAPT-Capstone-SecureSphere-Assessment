## 🧩 Project Overview
This project is part of my Cyber Security Capstone, focusing on **Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT)** of both a web application and a deliberately vulnerable virtual machine (Metasploitable3).  
The goal was to simulate real-world attack scenarios, identify vulnerabilities, and recommend remediation measures.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify security weaknesses in the web and system environments.
- Perform vulnerability scanning, exploitation, and reporting using industry-standard tools.
- Demonstrate risk impact and provide mitigation recommendations.

## 🧰 Tools & Frameworks Used
|      Phase     |            Tools            |                Purpose                    |
|----------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Reconnaissance | `whois`, `nslookup`, `nmap` | Information gathering & service discovery |
| Scanning       | `Nikto`, `dirb`             | Web vulnerability & directory enumeration |
| Exploitation   | `sqlmap`, `msfconsole`      | SQL Injection and system exploitation     |
| Reporting      | Markdown, MS Word           | Documentation and presentation            |

## 🧾 Summary of Findings
|   Vulnerability        |         Severity        |        Impact        |               Recommendation               |
|------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| SQL Injection          | Critical                | Database compromise  | Sanitize inputs; use parameterized queries |
| Weak Password Policy   | High                    | Unauthorized access  | Enforce complex passwords & MFA            |
| Outdated Software      | Medium                  | Exploitable flaws    | Regular patching and updates               |
| Misconfigured Firewall | Medium                  | Exposure of services | Limit open ports & harden network          |

---

## 🧩 Key Results
- Multiple open ports discovered (80, 443).  
- SQLi vulnerability confirmed through automated and manual testing.  
- Gained limited shell access on Metasploitable3 through Metasploit.  
- Recommendations provided for patching, input validation, and system hardening.
